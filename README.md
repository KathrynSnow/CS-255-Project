# CS-255-Project
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?  

The DriverPass project is owned by Liam.  He has created a cloud based online program to study, take practice tests, and drive with a trainer to increase the success rate of passing the driver license tests at the DMV.  The system allows a customer to set up their own driving times with a selected trainer, study and take practice tests.  They will be able to pay through the system and keep a profile of their use in the system.  The system allows the customer service personnel to create the profile for a customer.  The trainer and customer service personnel employees have their own profile with schedule details.  Liam the owner has access to everything including banking details.  DriverPass’ IT officer, Ian, has access to create, modify, delete materials in class study materials, tests, and reports to provide details for the company.  

 

What did you do particularly well? 

I feel confident in understanding, clarifying, and communicating the goals of DriverPass.  I would say the business requirements document was done well.  

 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I feel less confident in then system design concepts.  I do not feel I understand as well what it takes to make a system.  This is probably because I have never made a system, so it is just a concept not an experience.  As a professional in a different field, I know what if feels like to ‘know’. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

The success of an online business is that customers use the system.  Therefore, the user is the why you are building the system.  I think of all the systems I use online like the online classroom and portal, OneWalmart, and GoogleClassroom (to name a few).  I consider how they work based to what I am learning, and I make decisions about what I like.  DriverPass is based on what I think is the best of the systems I use.  Of course, Liam made requests that I considered and best practices I found in the reading.  

 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

The object-oriented strategy most appealed to me while doing the assignments.  The function-oriented design strategy was also comfortable, but I preferred looking at the objects and their jobs.  I approach most things Top Down in life as I prefer the big picture first, therefore I will almost always approach a design in that manner.  The books, “System Analysis and Design with UML” and “Modern System Analysis and Design” provided me with all the information regarding techniques and strategies I have.  I need life experiences in order to answer this question with full confidence.  I will follow best practices and the guidelines set up by the company where I work.
